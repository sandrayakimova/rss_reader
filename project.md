## Description

###### [rss_reader/rss_reader.py]

In rss_reader.py RSS-reader utility is initialized and configured. The utility provides the following features:

##### 1) *Data caching:*

The RSS news are stored in the local storage while reading. For this purpose [shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html), dictionary-like object, was used.
With the optional argument ```--date %Y%m%d``` (for example: ```--date 20191120```) the cashed news can be read. Also, adding URL make the displayed news sorted by date and link. 
If the news are not found - error should be returned.

##### 2) *Data conversion to .pdf and .html:*

The RSS-reader utility provides news converter to .pdf and .html formats. It can be accomplished with the following optional arguments: ```--to-pdf``` and ```--to-html```.
Both arguments receive the path where new file would be saved. The name of the file generates automatically.
There are two options for news conversion:

- *convert from cache*

For this case news conversion doesn't depend on internet. With ```rss_reader.py --date 20191120 --limit 1 --to-html ~/finaltask/rss-reader``` one news for the specified day would be converted (the same with ```--to-pdf```), and file with it would be generated in the specified PATH.
There would be clickable links to the full article and images.

- *convert fresh news from the Internet*

For this case Internet is required. With ```rss_reader.py https://news.yahoo.com/rss/ --limit 1 --to-html ~/finaltask/rss-reader``` one news from listed link would be converted (the same with ```--to-pdf```), and file with it would be generated in the specified PATH.
In this case all pictures would be clickable and would be displayed, if the format permits. Otherwise, there would be clickable links to the images. Also result would be contain a links to the full articles.

##### 3) *Output in colour:*

For colorizing the output there are ```--colorize``` optional argument. Utility provides colorization of the logs and RSS news output (json included).
