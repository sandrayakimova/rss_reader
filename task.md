# RssReader

RSS (RDF Site Summary, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Reading RSS is essential part of many applications.

## What to do

1. Setup the module using documentation provided inside. This will cause errors. There are 3 very simple errors inside - two typos and one incorrect indentation. Fix them so that the module could be used.
2. Test the module in order to obtain RSS from a remote sourse (https://techcrunch.com/feed/ for example) as an output.
3. Prepare a free-form report in English telling what you did and which results you obtained (don't forget to point out the module name, its requirements and in which file you've found the documentation. Also don't forget to include the full output you obtained).
